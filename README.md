**Multi-Function Arduino Robot**

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a multi-functional robot built using the Arduino platform. The project integrates autonomous navigation and remote-controlled capabilities into a single robotic chassis.

**Features**
Obstacle Avoidance: Uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to scan the environment and navigate around obstacles autonomously.

Bluetooth Control: Manual navigation via a smartphone application using an HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth module.

Voice Control: Support for voice-activated commands to control movement through a mobile interface.

**Hardware Components**
Microcontroller: Arduino UNO

Motor Driver: L293D Motor Driver Shield

Sensors: HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

Communication: HC-05 Bluetooth Module

Actuators: * 4 x DC Gear Motors

1 x SG90 Servo Motor

Power: 2 x 18650 Li-ion Batteries (7.4V)

Chassis: Foam board or acrylic base with 4 wheels

**Software Requirements**
IDE: Arduino IDE

**Libraries:**

AFMotor.h (for the L293D Shield)
Servo.h (for ultrasonic scanning)





Servo.h (for ultrasonic scanning)
